## üìò Section A: Concepts

### 1. What does it mean for a time series to be *stationary*? Why is stationarity important in time series modeling?

Stationary process is a type of stochastic process (random process) where the statistical properties, like the mean and variance do not change over time. Stationarity is a crucial concept in time series analysis because it simplifies modeling and forecasting. A stationary time series has statistical properties (mean, variance, autocovariance) that do not vary over time, making it easier to model patterns and predict future values. Non-stationary series, which exhibit trends or seasonality, can lead to inaccurate model results.

### 2. What is the difference between **autocovariance** and **autocorrelation**? Why is autocorrelation often preferred in practice?

---

### 3. Explain the purpose of the **Autocorrelation Function (ACF)** and **Partial Autocorrelation Function (PACF)**. What does a slow decay in the ACF indicate?

---

### 4. What is the null hypothesis of the **Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF)** test? What does a p-value < 0.05 suggest about the time series?

---

### 5. If you had a time series that was non-stationary, what steps could you take to make it stationary?

---

## üìä Section B: Applied Interpretation

You generated the ACF, PACF, and performed the ADF test on your stock log returns. Based on your results:

### 6. What did your ACF and PACF plots show about autocorrelation in your return series?

---

### 7. What was the p-value of your ADF test? What was your conclusion ‚Äî is your return series stationary?

---

### 8. What impact does your conclusion from Q7 have on your ability to use this series in future forecasting models?

---

## üß† Bonus Challenge (Optional):

### 9. Simulate two series using Python: one stationary and one non-stationary. Describe the visual and statistical differences.

(Hint: Try using `np.random.normal()` for stationary and `np.cumsum()` for non-stationary.)
