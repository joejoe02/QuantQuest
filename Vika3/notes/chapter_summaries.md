ðŸ“˜ Supplementary Reading â€“ Textbook Chapters for Week 3

To deepen your understanding of return mechanics, distribution characteristics, and strategy assumptions, the following textbook chapters are highly relevant for Week 3's learning:

# Chapter 2 â€“ Returns

2.1.1â€“2.1.3: Definitions of Net, Gross, and Log Returns. Essential for calculating and interpreting returns for backtesting.

2.2.1â€“2.2.2: Covers the Random Walk and Geometric Random Walk, which underpin the assumption of asset price evolution in many trading models.

2.4: Practical simulation exercises (e.g., McDonaldâ€™s stock) reinforce log returns and pricing over time.



# Chapter 4 â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis

4.2: Histograms and Kernel Density Estimation â€“ useful for analyzing your return distribution.

4.6: Data Transformations â€“ normalization and log-transformations that improve model behavior.

4.11 (optional): Exercises that can be applied to your stock return dataset to practice EDA.



# Chapter 5 â€“ Modeling Univariate Distributions

5.4: Skewness and Kurtosis â€“ helpful for understanding return asymmetry and fat tails.

5.5: Heavy-Tailed Distributions â€“ why stock returns often don't follow a perfect normal curve.

5.12â€“5.13: AIC/BIC and validation â€“ foundations for comparing model fit if extending your strategy modeling.
